### Welcome to my 490 Final Project
# the idea

Many students find it very difficult to know the exact time and
location of busses in the university, This cause students to wait for
almost 30 minutes.

Sometimes the bus will come but not pass through the road to check
for waiting students , bus might use different path for the interest of
driver.

KAU Bus Tracking application will help us overcome these problems by:
- Students can search for buses and know their locations and time.
- Drivers can locate the waiting students.
- Drivers can mark if the bus is full or not.
- The application provide schedule for buses.
